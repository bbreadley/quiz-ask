# Opening the file
## Website 
First, you will need a browser. Once you're done with that, open the file `index.html`. To change the website's code, open `app.js` using an IDE like **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. To change the website's styling, decorations, color, etc, open `style.css`. 

If you wish to add everything into a single HTML file, copy everything inside `app.js` and paste into the the `<head />` section of the index file inside a `<script> [code goes here] </script>` tag. For CSS, copy everything inside `style.css` and paste into the `<head />` section inside a `<style> [style goes here] </style>`. Please note that this clutters the file and it is recommended to have them separated
